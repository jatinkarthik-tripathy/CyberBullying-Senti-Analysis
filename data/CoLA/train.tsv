2004	0	a	 Glee who? ha
9603	0	a	 It depends  you have to ask yourself; is there a chance we could ever be something? If the answer is yes  then thats a good start. You need to get to know that person and then go from there.  If the answer is &quot;not a chance!&quot; then  its really shit  but you need to stop yourself from falling any harder than you already have. I know its hard to do  and its much easier for someone else to say &quot;get over them&quot; because its a fucking hard thing to do! To get over someone  especially when you have fallen hard  it really hurts  but you need to catch it before it ends up getting worse. You know? If you know there definitely isn't a chance between you  and you know that you are ready for a relationship  its probably best to find someone else and concentrate your feelings on them instead. If you are willing to let your feelings (for the other person go)  involving yourself with someone can let them melt away. Anyway  its never easy  and to persue them can be an easier way out  but it all depends on how strong you are  and the person you have fallen for. Okay  essay answer. Good luck :)

Don't get me started on this :S Why are places like Africa still in so much debt  when all they do is borrow money from other countries = to pay back other debts  therefore getting themselves worse in the process. Where is good will these days? Why cant 3rd world debt be abolished? As for poverty in other situations. Some people who are lazy and can't be bothered to give a shit  I don't feel for. But the people who are trying to get by  but cant because of tax and loans and owing people shit  what's the point? We are all people  cant we live the same? too many issues for a single post :)

Have you ever been there? Or would you want to get out of america?  I went there and I loved it  but I wasn't (and Im still not) 21 so I couldn't go out :( But it looked pretty lively and there again you have the beach to relax upon too :) So  what do you think? Its not TOO hot either  well it wasn't when I went so it sounds like a nice plan :) Lots of sunset walks and going out for dinner? Or staying in and ordering room service ;) lol

9638	0	a	 What's harder? DEFINITELY telling someone else. Only because  if someone is telling you how they feel  at least you have the control of the situation  and you can control how you react. However  if you are telling someone you love them  you have completely put yourself out there  and have no input on where the conversation goes next. Its all about having the control of the situation  and even if you don't feel the same  at least you aren't putting your heart on the line :)

9134	0	a	 Ummm  I don't think so lol. Saw Simon Cowell about a month ago. Ermmmm  the nicest people? Well I am obviously biased  but I think I would Say Lily  with Kat close behind :) Lily is SOOOO down to earth  and I Really could imagine myself being good friends with her in real life. As for Kat  she was lovely too  but Kat has a VERY cool exterior  and because she gets a REAL lot of people talking to her  she has a lot to deal with  you know what I mean? When I met Kaya  I didn't actually like her. Both times :( the first time  I was outside the cinema  and Luke  Kat  Lily and Kaya were just going in. I called out &quot;Kat!&quot; and she looked around  really shocked! LOL! Then I spoke to them  and Kaya shouted &quot;come on! The film has already started!&quot; and Lily followed her inside the theater. Luke and Kat were stood there  and we were all just looking at each other  not knowing what to do. I said &quot;don't worry. ITs okay  enjoy your film&quot; and Both Luke and Kat looked at each other  replying &quot;no no no&quot; and walked back over to me :D I LOVED IT! That was SUCH a nice feeling! Knowing they were missing their film to come and talk to me! So anyway  I spoke to Luke first  then I started talking to Kat and Luke went on inside. Then I was saying how much I loved Emily  etc etc etc (crazy fangirl behaviour lol) and she said thanks  did a cute thumbs up thing  I said bye  and she did a cute wave. She was adorable then! Anyway  the second time I met Kaya  it was at the Skins House. She had been in the VIP area upstairs ALL night  and she had just come down  for about 5 minutes. I saw her  and walked over asking for a photo. She was talking to someone  so I just stood there and patiently waited. Then she stopped  and I tapped her on the shoulder. Nothing. So she started talking to someone else. I waited until she finished  and tapped again. Nothing. Then she started talking again  I waited  tapped again. Nothing. So I started saying &quot;kaya?&quot;  nothing. Said it again  nothing :( Then she started to walk away  up some stairs  back into the VIP room  and she was running up pretty fast so I couldn't follow :( Later on  I saw her again  and I asked her to sign my magazine cover. She said yes  and then she had just signed a 'k' and then someone walked into her  causing her to smudge the pen/marker. At this point  she hasn't even signed half her name  but she just said 'sorry' and walked off  leaving me stood there with a magazine with the entire cast's signatures on  and a 'k' over Kaya's photo. I wasn't too impressed if im honest  especially because I wasn't being pushy :( anyway  I did eventually manage to get a quick photo with her  but it was a bit of a job to get there :( Hmm  the cutest? Probably Meg :) She has quite low self asteem actually! When I met her at the filming  she was just sat by herself  watching the filming. Then we went over and started chatting to her  and she was saying how she had been there 10 hours and they hadn't even used her in anything yet :( Then we had a photo with her  and looking back at it  she was like &quot;OMG! I look terrible!&quot; even though she looked adorable :) Then there was when I met her at the house party. She was pretty sweet then too. I think she was a bit nervous actually because in the beginning  she was walking around holding Lukes hand and it was just so sweet to see :) Then  she went outside and was smoking practically the entire night lol. She was a drowned little rat! She was drenched! But still looked adorable :)

9650	0	a	 Well  it may not be that stupid  but I will always remember it. All through school  I was always the good girl who never got into trouble. I remember during secondary school  in year 8 (which is about age 11/12) I was on a lunch break and I and all my friends bought a plate of chips for dinner. We were sat eating them in the cafeteria  and people started throwing their chips at us  so my friends started throwing them back  but I refused to join in because I didn't want to get into trouble. Anyway  after much persuasion from my friends  I decided to throw ONE chip to get them off my back. I did  and guess what happened? The teacher saw me  NO ONE else  just me  and I got sent to detention for a week. I was so pissed! lol! Everyone found it funny bar me. Not good...lol

9646	0	a	 Probably their eyes. Thats what you look at when you talk to someone  and you can tell a lot about a person from looking into their eyes. Not what is going on with them and their life history  of course not  but you can get a vibe of 'what that person is like' if that makes sense? sometimes you are wrong  but hey  its the best judge of character when looking at someone :)

9649	0	a	 Well  I remember once  when we had not long been back from seeing &quot;The Grudge&quot; in the cinema  and I had an idea to freak my mum out. So  the next day  I got down this polystyrene head thing that I had  drew eyes on it with eyeliner  and pulled out this fake black wig I had from a fancy dress thing and dressed the wig with it. I then pulled out a floaty white dress thing that I had in my wardrobe  and kind of draped it over the head  making it look like a person. I then hung the head up  in a really odd angle in my parents cupboard under the stairs. When my mum came home  I called her and asked her to get me a bottle of drink from the cupboard  and she said yes. Me and my dad were waiting for the scream  and she returned with the bottle of drink  having not made a sound. Me and my dad were stunned  and asked her if she had seen &quot;it&quot;. &quot;Seen what?&quot; she replied....total and utter fail....lol

7132	0	a	 Richard Aldington is probably best known for being one of the first three Imagist poets  along with Ezra Pound and H.D. Around the Fall of 1912 in London  Pound proclaimed himself and his two good friends to be the three original Imagists  and was instrumental in getting the early poems of Aldington and H.D. published in Poetry Magazine (edited by Pound's friend Harriet Monroe in Chicago). The three poets established a set of principles to guide their writings. Pound recorded them in &quot;A Retrospect&quot; (Literary Essays of Ezra Pound. London: Faber &amp; Faber  1954): r r r In the spring or early summer of 1912  'H.D.'  Richard Aldington and myself decided that we were agreed upon the three principles following:r 1. Direct treatment of the 'thing' whether subjective or objective.r 2. To use absolutely no word that does not contribute to the presentation.r 3. As regarding rhythm: to compose in the sequence of the musical phrase  not in the sequence of a metronome. r r yes i stole it from google so shoot me

A little over protective but only enough to show that he truly cares. He brings flowers home for me being his girlfriend day! :] If I want anything he'd get it but knows I have everything I want. Compassionate and caring and loves everything that I do. He enjoys all the same foods as I do and is open to exploring new boundaries he's never expierenced. Ohh and He let's me be crazy about things that Im so passionate about  that most guys would laugh at and make fun of. Recycling  planting flowers and smiling at people just because I want to make their day! :] He's perfect for me. He understands me in every aspect a man could. Hes sweet enough to damper my attitude and sarcasm at times but bullheaded enough to not always give in to me. Lets me whine if I want attention and holds me more than I could ever want to be held. I love him. And for me  hes my perfet guy! <3r Ohh and he's a super sexxy stud :] of course.

So he said about not taking it to Brighton with me  and just using the busses and trains to get about. This bloody sucks  BUT then he had the bloody cheek to say &quot;we might as well sell yours. You aren't going to be using it for nearly a year  I will look into putting it online&quot; WTF DAD!!! YOU ARE NOT SELLING IT! I WANT IT WHEN I COME HOME!!!! :'(

I used to try and do all my college work at night which meant I ended up staying up really late  concentrating and went to bed with an energetic mind. Also  my job  because I get home VERY late in comparison to normal jobs   and the work that I do  involves your mind to be VERY active and stuff (ie remembering loads of things to do in your head) I come home  and Im still not able to go to bed until my head has calmed down a bit. So yeah  now its just got worse and worse and worse  but Im dealing :) I think I should just move into your time zone. Just saying :P

Sometimes I do things for people (family  friends etc) and I don't really feel gratitude for it. So I suppose  putting in loads of effort to something  and it not being appreciated is a slap in the face :(

It was pretty funny  because if you were female  it was free to get in  but the boys had to pay.  The night was rather lame  because it was about our 3rd night out in a row  and 4 days without sleep  I was sat on a couch just watching people  not knowing where to look lol! I was only 16  so it was damn illegal to be there  but thats prague for you :P Then I was looking for someone  and I ended up falling down the stairs LOL! Good times...

I was on a family vaca Woowhoo in the smokies  and we stopped on the side of the road to hang out in a creek and i sooo had to take a crap. We were nowhere close to anything and I did in the woods on the side of the road. And of course people pulled right infront of my parents mini and got out to come down in the creek too. I dont think anyone saw me but that was potentially embarrassing. haha My family found it hilarious.

I turned back to my computer and my sister went really quiet  so I turned to look at her  and she was happily trying to rub off Kat's signature off of my DIVA magazine. Yeah  I wasn't too happy! Luckily she didn't but thats not the point :( She is 23 too  so should have known hell better :S Really sad?

9675	0	a	 Well im a sucker for someone who can be original. Like  say just getting a take away and going somewhere really nice  sitting under the stars eating it. I think my perfect date would involve a beach walk during sunset (has to be a warm night) then sitting down with a picnic under the stars watching the sun finally set. Dreamy much! LOL

10490	0	a	 ahahahaha ;D maybe LOL
9277	0	a	 Yes. I think so yes  in different ways too. If someone gets you  why can't you return the favour? I think revenge  can show people something too  if that makes sense? Shows you how something feels. Take Naomily for example  Emily kissing that girl  it showed Naomi (in a really small sense) how Emily is feeling  even though it doesn't compare  Emily blatantly did it on purpose to get back at her  and I would probably do the same in her position. So  yes  I think it can be :)
11727	0	a	 I still Love you. yo my Ex Wife

Then when I was 15  I quit and got myself a job at the local charity shop. It only paid u00a33.50 an hour  but I was only 15 :) Then at 16  I went to a retail clothing shop for a year  it got crap  so I moved to another one (H&amp;M  you might have heard of it) then a year later  I went to TGI fridays  and I have been there for 2 years :) Part time though  while I was at college and stuff :)

9520	0	a	 Oh god! Okay  ready for an essay from me this time? :P  So  I was born. Which I don't remember  otherwise that would have been a sight! I open my eyes  to see and hear &quot;pushhhhhhhhh&quot; and a little slit with light coming through-ahem! I shall start a little later :P  I went to primary school  and all through the 6 years  I was such a good girl  and I was even encouraged by a teacher to do something wrong because I saw so innocent.  I got bullied pretty badly through the years 4-6 and eventually I started to stick up for myself towards the end  so they dropped it and left me alone. I won :D Anyway  In year 6 I had my first (and little did I know  last) crush on a boy. I told my mum  and she got really excited that i was 'growing up'. Well  this crush was really big (or at least I thought it was at the time) and I Remember at our end of year prom thing  he asked me out. I got really embarrassed and I ended up saying no (which I kicked myself for in the end). I started secondary school  and my parents wanted me to go to the school that my sister goes to. It is SUCH a good school  but I refused because all my friends were going to my local one  and I wanted to go with them. Well I started school fine  and got along really well with everyone. About a year later  the people who I went to school with  aka my friends from primary school  started to pick on me. It got really bad again  and I ended up having no one.  I met another friend  Laura and she helped me through everything. Eventually we became best friends  and the other group of friends now started to pick on her because she was friends with me. One day  I thought enough is enough  and I went to a teacher about the bullying. She phoned up both of our parents  and let them know what was happening. About a week later  once things had started to calm down a little  the girl who bullied me  her mum phoned up the school  saying that I was now bullying her! I was called into a meeting with the bully herself and another teacher to sort this out. This teacher was crap  and basically believed everything the other girl was saying  just because she was coming off &quot;sweet and innocent&quot;. My mum heard about this  and called up the bullys mum to have a chat with her. She came around our house  and was trying to pick a fight with my mum outside  all while I was listening to them argue while hiding under the stairs. She left  and my mum refused to engage in a fight over something that could be sorted without parental violence. Nothing was ever sorted  and I think the girl (the bully) got a little scared about being found out and her mums temper  that she finally left me alone. So  I was happy again :)  I finished secondary school pretty happy. I was top of most of my classes  and i even was entered into this british art competition by my art teacher  which I won :D I loved art at school  and every lunch and after school  my art teacher let us have her room so I could sit and carry on with my work. Because I loved it so much! she wouldn't let anyone else in their  except for me and my friends  because I was her no1 student :) Well  life was good until I started to become confused about my sexuality. I didn't think much about it at first  only that all my friends were talking about 'boys' and I couldn't agree or relate to anything that they were saying.  Well  I finished school really confused  and went onto college to study further subjects. I grew apart from my old friends  because being in a different college  with a different time table  its awkward to keep in touch so well as you were before. So I made a new circle of friends  and I got really close to one girl in particular. We became best friends  and told eachother everything. About 2 years after being friends  I decided I wanted to tell someone about me being gay  and thought she was the best person to tell. So  I told her  and almost instantly  she abandoned me :( We didn't really speak anymore  and I know it was because I freaked her out  and she didnt want to have a 'lesbian' as her best friend :(  So  I moved on and decided I didn't want to have a friend like her if something as small as sexuality would ruin our relationship. So anyway  I started my art foundation year  and I FUCKING LOVED IT!!! It was one of the best times of my life  and Idid love the end parts in particular. I went through that phase  of not being bothered to go  and I did take a bit of time off (usually to sleep on at home lol)  but I still came out with one of the best grades out of a couple of hundred people. So I was really proud :D  Anyway  once finishing that year  I didn't know what I wanted to continue on to university  so I decided to take a gap year  and build up a little money and sort my head out with what I actually wanted to do. in the year I was working for my parents a bit  property developing and stuff. The year turned into 2  and I kind of went astray from any dreams that I really wanted. Which is why I did something about it  got my ass in gear and applied to Brighton Film School. Well  I got in  as you know  and that pretty much leads me up to now :)  Soooo  I AM SO SORRY about this essay :P I hope you haven't fallen asleep  and I sincerely appologise if you have :( So  in response to yours  you don't have to apologise about it being long! and it wasn't boring  its interesting to hear everything that has gone on with your life. I would consider you as a friend too  so that means I want to know about everything :D

3685	0	a	 lol who wrote this :/
9257	0	a	 Ummm  probably kind of the same as the last answer  in a weird way. Sensitivity? Only because  being a girl and someone doing something for you  either a friend  family member or a lover  you appreciate it so much more. Also  being a girl (this is going to sound terrible) but you are able to handle things better  and are able to understand how a certain person is feeling or thinking  and you can react to it in the right way. If that makes sense? Men  again some  not all  are less sensitive  and don't understand why that person is crying or angry  but being a girl. You just know :)

9604	0	a	 It depends on what it is  if its something that involves or affects you  then you call them out on it. If its something that is personal to them  then let them come to you in their own time. Either way  give them time to come to you about it  and then resort to the above option after you've given them a chance to explain. I don't know if that really helps?

9259	0	a	 Well I am independent in the sense that I don't care what other people think (about certain things anyway) and I don't let anything else influence what I wear or say.  A lot of people say my dress sense is &quot;unique&quot; and I would agree lol. I still live at home  only because I have no other choice. Im only 20  and you will see what its like to be still pretty young and not have the biggest income. If I moved out  I would be paying rent for somewhere  but I couldn't even afford to live. So whats the point in moving out? I will in time  well in september. So its going to be a nice break :) When I am at home  im independent in the sense that I like to be in my bedroom or by myself doing things (not that Im a loner lol) I just find it easier to concentrate on something if no one else is there. You know what I mean? I sound completely weird don't I??? O_O lol!

9840	0	a	 Because Charlie is also short for charlotte  and time for a story I think...  Once upon a time  there was a young girl called Charlotte. She was a pretty little girl  and everyone loved her. only one problem is  she had a great love for sports and all things male. She came out to her parents as being gay  and they wouldn't tolerate such a thing! So  they sent her to the nearby hospital and attached...pieces  and removed....bits.  She comes out  or is it still a she? His parents decided to cure the 'gay' issue  by changing her into a boy. Her former name  Charlotte had to be changed  and by rule of easiness  they changed it to Charles  so her former nickname would still be of use (they didn't want to change her name again  costing them more by deed poll). Charlie lived happily ever after  marrying the woman of his dreams... The end :)

10651	0	a	 Search &quot;LMAO&quot; in Google ;)
9424	0	a	 Hmmm  well I think Naomi deserves everything that she is getting  especially seeing as she isn't doing anything to win Emily back. She cheated on her  said &quot;I'll do anything&quot; then that was it. There wasn't any making Emily feel special  she was just moping about :S BUT  I think they both need to talk it out now. I think  with Emily  its going too far and they just need to sort it out  even argue it out  but at least get things said and out in the open. They are trying to act as though things are fine  even though both of them know it isn't. I think it is driving them both insane  and perhaps thats why Emily is looking at Mandy  maybe as a way out? I know for sure they are going to sort everything out  but I am disappointed it is going to be so late in the series :(

9513	0	a	 Hmm  thats a hard one. It depends on where the tattoo or piercing is. I LOVE tongue lip (centre stud) piercings  and any in your ear  as for tattoos. As long as its nothing too cheap looking  or nothing too big  or on your face or something :S So yeah  piercings :) I CAN NOT STAND eyebrow piercings though. Thats probably the worst for me (besides weird cheek studs or something :S)
11690	0	a	 I would tell them to grow up. Love takes a while to grow
3595	0	a	 dont talk to me :(
9210	0	a	 The think with romance  I think something that can kill the spontaneity in a relationship  is asking your partner &quot;What should we do? How can I make you happy? Tell me and I will do it&quot;. Apart from the obvious answer that makes most people happy ;) its not romantic to tell someone how you want to be treated. I would feel much better  if my partner made an effort and figured it out. Even if they didn't figure out exactly what I wanted to do  I would love them that much more for making the effort to show me that they love me. Does this make sense?

8800	0	a	 I LOVE to wear dresses  indeed I do! Im more a casual dress person  as in I go out in the day in a dress  rather than dressing up in a really special dress in the evening. If that makes sense? I Still wear dresses in the evening  obviously  but im not one of those people who says 'Im wearing a dress for special occasions only'. I think I actually wear dresses more than any other item of clothing. Besides leggings that is  but they usually come together :)

Lmao no i dont think you &quot;owned&quot; if you get married if your partner is going to have that attitude then they insecure and going to lead to a divorse so fast

9948	0	a	 HAHA! Yeah  we start college at 16  and then finish at 18  to go to university and usually come out about 21/22 with your degree depending on what you major in. Most degrees are 3 years  but if you wanted to be a Vet or a Doctor or a Surgeon etc  its about 6/7 years. Completely depends on the course :) The course im doing in september  basically gives me the equivilent of a degree  but in one year. Then I have the access to continue for another year  (making it a total of 2) to gain a masters in motion picture production  and the area I specialised in. So  Film School can definitely be a quicker route through education  but it is a lot more intense.

1929	0	a	 The most major flaw in our Justice system are the corrupt people behind the surface that keeps the system running for the wrong reasons. Using the government as a face for greed  selfishness  caring less for the good for humanity and getting ahead before another country. r Sadly  we can't make them more stable. There will always be corrupt in the system-therefore never allowing the good for human kind to prosper in the end. Never. Just my opinion though  what do I know.

8813	0	a	 HAHA! Your answer to this question made me laugh! The car that I really wanted  (before I settled with mine) was a 5 dr Toyota Rav 4 :P In light metallic blue with grey bumpers! Made me laugh that we wanted the same one lol!  So anyway  my dream car  do you mean affordable or in a dream world? I will say both :) If money wasn't an option  I would probably choose something like a porshe Carrera GT Cabriolet  only because <333333333 But in the real world  I am happy to say I own my dream car :D A New Beetle Cabriolet. I have it in light metallic blue and have blue and white flowers/birds down the side. If I could change the colour  I would. I LOVEEEEEEE the dark metallic navy one  with the cream leather. I would actually jizz if I ever bought one like that! LOL! It costed me just over u00a37 000 and that was a lot of money for me having just turned 19  but I saved up and managed to get it :) The insurance is a bitch though  but luckily its fairly economical to run :) I also really wanted to own a Jeep Wrangler Golden Eagle in Black  but they came out last year I think  and its far too much money for me to spend on a car. Besides  they devalue really easily  and rust quite badly :(

9763	0	a	 Well I had a HORRIBLE DREAM last night  but it was about work  so does that count? :P I dreamt that everyone (staff wise) was sent home because it was quiet  so it was just me and my manager in the restaurant (like it has been for the last couple of shifts I have worked). We suddenly had this MAD rush of people through the door  and it got really busy. Thing is  I was the only member of staff on  and my manager wasn't turning anyone away  so I was running the whole restaurant by myself. I think I was about to faint in my dream  because of the stress of everyone yelling at me for something to do  that I woke up lol. Then I fell back to sleep rather quickly and went back into it :'( Anywayyy...that doesn't count I take it :P  Well I argue with my family a lot  and I don't really get on with my father. So  we are ALWAYS arguing over things  and it really gets me down. We had a massive argument on tuesday night about something (he treats my sister differently  better  even though she is the one that causes all the trouble). This argument got VERY heated  and I ended up being stuck in my room ALL night  completely starving and thirsty but I wasn't going out to face him lol.

Just because if anything ever happened and you went through a 'rough patch'  sometimes other people can make you see things clearer. So  I think they can  but to have someone else outside the relationship is even more important.

8689	0	a	 Oh god yes! I know lots of people today  are totally skipping marriage  and I don't really think that it changes much in someones relationship. However  marriage is about loyalty to each other  and I love that :) I wouldn't want a marriage to change my life from how it was before though (if that makes sense?)  I don't think a certificate saying that you both are legally now joined should change the way you treat each other. Getting married can also take a spark out of a relationship  and thats sad :(

9571	0	a	 Because of the job that I do  I am constantly meeting and engaging with new people. Some of them are nice  some of them...not. Some weird  some eccentric  some rude  some polite. Its hard to put a definition on 'weirdest' and to pin a certain person down. Definitely some of the customers I meet are very weird (if I take it as the 'odd' interpretation)  for example  once I had 2 guys sat down in one of my tables  and one kept staring at me. It was a little offputting  so I tried to avoid them as much as I could. When I was putting their food down  a member of staff (a guy) said bye to me  gave me a hug and a kiss on the cheek. The guy on my table  stood up  eyed him with the worst look as my friend walked out. He then looked at me and said &quot;he doesn't appreciate your eyes. He looks about 12  pshhhhh&quot;  then sat down and ate. LOL!!! Thats just one weirdo  I meet a lot :P

There are a lot of modern designs which are really really empty  which I don't really love. Anyway  I love things that are unusual and colourful  so I suppose it could be a mix of both? :)

9862	0	a	 This is annoying it didn't appear :( How many others aren't appearing too :'( Anyway  to re-answer :) I think its quite sad when you change your name  only because I see it (kind of) as a way that you are giving up on your family and ditching them for a new one. BUT  I also see it as a wonderful way  when you gain someone elses name  because you are being accepted into your loved ones family  and thats awesome <3 So to solve all  I actually like double barreled names :) You don't give up your own  but you still gain your loved ones. Its like bringing both families together  rather than dropping or gaining  you get both :) How about you?

8919	0	a	 You loved reading it? Pshhh  was boring :P lol I think both of ours were a bit depressing  but thats the things that stick out most in life  so automatically we remember the sad things over the happier things. Its how our minds work :) Hmmm  future plans. Well apart from wanting a family  and to be happily in love with a successful home and car etc etc As for career plans  my ultimate goal would be to direct independent horror films :) I love how some of them can contain so much art (visually) as they can video. When I say independent  I mean things like &quot;The Descent&quot;  &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot;  &quot;28 Days Later&quot; etc etc. Im not so much into big budget epic Hollywood movies  because it takes the essence out of capturing a moving image on film. They rely too much on special effects nowadays  and I prefer the retro approach to film making :)

9109	0	a	 Awwwww! I miss you too :( Im going to miss you lots today too  seeing as I have the crapfest of waitressing tonight :'''( Come and save me? Thanks :D Ohhh  and I had another dream last night! Which  I am glad to say you weren't in this one :S It was HORRRRRRRIBLE!!!!!!!!  So  it started off  I was in this really historic City  something like Prague  and I was with my sister. We saw this dog running around  crying out because half of its belly's skin had been ripped off!!! IT had blood ALL over it  but no one could catch the dog to take it to the vets. Anyway  I eventually managed to get it  and my sister (trainee vetinary nurse) was taking a look at him. Then I saw a manager from work  and I don't know how  but I just knew that he had done it. I spoke to him  and he was like &quot;I found this machine  that latches on to a piece of skin  then you pull the handle and it rips it off&quot;. I went HYSTERICAL and was asking what the fuck he thinks he was doing.  So then I ended up at home somehow  and the dog was at the vets Im guessing (i don't know where it went) and then I was reading up about this machine. It said that people who work nights  they used this machine on them (to remove all their skin) so that they weren't able to work in the day  and so outside people could tell the difference between night and day workers (WTF?!?!?!?!) lol. So anyway  I was really freaked out that my manager was going to come and get us (because I lost it on him about the dog) and I told my family  but they didn't really seem to believe me. So time went on  and I was sat in my room  and my sister and mum were randomally led in my bed  really scared. My manager got into the house and eventually attacked my mum. I lost it and grabbed a massive kitchen cake knife thing. I lunged at him  and started attacking his arms to get him to let go of my mum. He did  then he started trying to stab me  all while I kept slicing his arms with this knife. Eventually I went for it  and I slashed his throat!!! He didn't stop  so I had to do it again  a bit deeper. That still didn't stop him  so I started sawing at his neck to cut his head off. Nothing. He was still cutting my arms with his knife thing  so I kicked him to the floor and pushed down all of my weight onto the blade and eventually cut his head clean off!!!! Then he started laughing (even though his head was detached) and said about a bomb that he planted would be going off right about now and we had no time to get out. So we lost. I had a &quot;SHITTTTTT!&quot; moment  and me and my dad were trying to get my family out of the house  then I woke up....So im guessing I would have exploded??? O_O So yeah  im glad you weren't in that one :) Can I have a hug please? That wasn't nice :'''''''(

8561	0	a	 I don't think they is really such thing as normal. But if I was to attempt to define it  then &quot;Normal could be defined as something that is socially acceptable  and would be considered 'the norm'. Its something that the majority of people live by. Anything different would be considered &quot;unusual&quot; therefore  not normal&quot;...

3310	0	a	 okay thankyou  your a great help.
9060	0	a	 Im not really the person who does the asking out  if im completely honest. I don't have very much self confidence (as you should know from reading my answers already)  so its not a move I would generally do. I leave it up to the other person  hence why I am probably still single lol. I could ask them out to do something  but I wouldn't strictly say &quot;want to go for coffee?&quot; type of ask out  that just isn't me :)
8152	1	a	 O_O Woah woah. That's nice.
8950	0	a	 HAPPY VALENTINES DAY TOO! (Even though I dont really agree with it :P) Personally  I dont think that there can be love at first sight. I think there can be what is described as a very strong connection  but I dont think it is instantly love. I could never love someone without knowing their personality first  so  for me. I have no belief  but I think you can determine whether you could love them from a first meeting :)

7774	0	a	 Thank you nate. I appreciate it. I believe in you also.
9008	0	a	 Well  a little while ago  I started chatting online  and I was always up until very late hours of the morning speaking to them  only because I wanted to  no other reason. Well  I did it  continuously for several months  and now  whenever I try to go to bed earlier  (even if im absolutely shattered) I just can't get to sleep :( My sleeping pattern is REALLY messed up  and although I wouldn't go back to change it  I still need to sort something out  but I don't know what. I have been to the doctors about it  several times  and the final time  he eventually perscribed me some medication. Thing is  it was a pretty heavy dose of something that was VERY addictive and caused a lot of bad side effects. I started to take them  and they didn't make ay difference at all. I finished the packet  and they made no change to my sleeping that there wasn't a point in continuing and getting hooked on anything dangerous. So all in all  im pretty screwed :( I go to bed  perhaps 3am  but I don't get to sleep until about 5/6am and im normally woken up not long after with my family leaving to go to work. So I go back to sleep  im woken again  and this continues until I actually get up a few hours later.  I think this needs to be sorted :( I need my life back :'(
963	0	a	 Nope. Show your face? why dont you?
473	0	a	 I'm not fake : )

5552	0	a	 have fun cleaning im sure i will miss u to
9881	0	a	 Good Looking I think. Just because being rich can attract the wrong crowd all together! I wouldn't want to be popular because of my money and I know there are crowds that are drawn to that. I would rather be popular for being me  and being good looking certainly adds to that. There was something on the TV I watched once  and they said that better looking people are more likely to be employed for a job than uglier ones. This is because  when they see someone who is attractive in how they dress  hair etc  it shows they are self caring and someone who doesn't take much effort in their appearance  could show that they aren't willing to give much effort in that field of work. It was scientifically proven  but I think its bullshit really lol  or should be at least :)
9100	0	a	 I DOOOOOOO! Apart from in the beginning when I was getting some REALLY awkward questions :) No  wait....I still loved it :D

It also means we can speak out  but the 1st Amendment doesn't stop with just speaking out  it means we have Freedom of Speech to say what we want in any Language we choose.

8940	0	a	 Collections? Do you mean  do I collect stuff? Well  its funny you ask that  because I used to be a collect-a-holic! Literally anything and everything! I was a hoarder! lol I have grown out of it a bit now  but I still have a lot of the stuff upstairs. You remember the TVs show Buffy and Angel? Well I LOVED them  and I spent about u00a36 000 or something ridiculous collecting all the merchandise they made. Literally EVERYTHING they would release  I would buy with any pocket money or birthday money I would get. I loved collecting all that  but it took up so much space that it went into the loft :( As for other things  Art Sticks (otherwise known as decorated drum sticks)  guitars  shoes (to an extent)  oh everything! lol! Anything someone could collect  I collected it. :/

9885	1	a	 Probably prison. Prisons today are actually getting better :) I mean  say you didn't have any money  and it meant you were going to be living on the streets  and homeless for however long that took. I would go and commit a crime that enabled me to go to prison. Nothing to hurt anyone  but perhaps a robbery or something where I intended on getting caught lol. It has to be better in there than living on the streets. Anyway  this wasn't the question....Prison. Just because  I don't think it is that bad in there. I mean yeah  I can't really know  not properly  but aside from being beaten up (perhaps) it can't be too bad. Better than being dead lol. If not  then just try something and kill yourself :S lol!
8124	1	a	 Ahahahahahaha. I'm sure :D

8522	0	a	 Not really. Again  because of my insomnia  when I get up  im usually pretty tired  but I tend to snap out of it as time goes on. It's actually annoying  it might be 7 at night  and Im really tired  but by the time it reaches 11 or something  I AM A HYPER LITTLE THING. Rather irritating considering thats normal peoples bedtime-ish...
8987	0	a	 Hmmmm  I don't know whats hidden  but I have talents :) I have played the piano since I was about 7  the drums since I was 10  I came top of my school with my art and music grades and coursework. I completed one of the top pieces of work in my college course. Plus other things  but I don't want to continue and make you think I feel a lot about myself lol. I don't  Im just proud of some of my achievements :)

9884	0	a	 Hmmmm  it depends on how much effort they had to put into each of them. I mean  if someone was an artist and they painted me a picture  it wouldn't mean so much if say a writer painted me a picture. Or vice versa  if a writer wrote me a poem or an artist wrote me a poem  that one would mean more. Its all about which one took the most effort and concentration to do  you know what I mean? :D

I would hopefully be starting out in smaller projects (perhaps even as a runner) and by 5 years  would like to see myself having created some successful short films to take to international short film festivals. In 10 years  I would like to see myself having started out in direction or production of small independent films  and starting to settle down with a family :)

I would kind of think the same thing. I would prolly pull over if Timothy was with me  definantly. But alone i'd have to pass and turn around..contemplating.

5874	0	a	 Soak in the hot tub
8875	0	a	 Hmmm  well 'the one' may not actually be the one. You know? I think everyone should fight for the right person  but it depends on how that effects that other person too. For example  say 'the one' was someone that perhaps didn't feel the same OR didn't treat you how you deserved to be treated  then I would settle for someone amazing  because in turn  that could be the one. It's all about giving them a chance :)
12543	0	a	 verbal  that's face to face
9088	0	a	 Oh I think its a good goal. Hmmmm  who might this mystery person be? Im liking it  I might have to find my own person to make-out with on a park bench in Paris. Hmmm  where can I find them? ;) <33 haha

829	0	a	 I am the master at skippping rocks!
8642	0	a	 Hmmm  my Garden. Well it has 2 sections to it.  It starts off with a pond and a patio area  then the first section is long and narrow (ish) and goes all the way to a square shapped holey trellace thing. Its all covered in grass  but then around the edges are flower beds and trees. If you go to the end of the garden and turn left  there is more kind of around the corner  behind our garage. Then it goes onto a raised patio platform thing with a swing chair thing and it goes a little more along the back (length ways). That doesn't make ANY SENSE! Here :) lol http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=11088742&amp;id=750810466 It goes on a bit longer  and goes around the corner a little at the top and bottom. Its an odd shape  so its hard to explain :P
6537	0	a	 WTF not 91 u doosh maybe 50 but member those other ones i was telling you about have you seen them yet?

5128	0	a	 Im most certainly am
1416	0	a	 yes
9239	0	a	 I don't think it would really be my place to get involved  but it would completely depend on their lover. If I thought  they treated my friend badly in the first place  I probably would just stay out of it  whereas if they didn't deserve it  I would try and intervene and tell my friend to sort herself out  and tell them  or break it off. It's not fair to lie either way :(

8643	0	a	 My house? Well  my family own 5  but I assume the one that I live in now? Its a detached bungalow with a loft conversion. Its rather cool actually  in the front left and right corners  we have turrets (in my bedroom and the dining room) which make it look slightly like a castle :D My drum kit is in one of the turrets  and I think it fits nicely :)  Then we have a wooden balcony thing overlooking the garden. The Garden is made up of 2 sections really. Its a long stretch of land thing  then at the end  you turn left and it goes back and along slightly  hard to explain really lol.
12093	0	a	 LMAO never girly. I have done some really dumb things though......

It you still wanted to stay very girly  and for a warm summer evening BBQ lets say something like this: http://www.polyvore.com/running_away_from_you/set?id=16955552 OR this: http://www.polyvore.com/sweet_memories/set?id=16463192 For an evening look  perhaps dinner out or an evening at the pub maybe a punked up and spicier look: http://www.polyvore.com/baby_you_rock/set?id=16444872 Perhaps going out to a club scene or something a bit more dressed up  a black ensemble? http://www.polyvore.com/bez_naslova/set?id=15743111 and because I know you like Jeans  how about a comfortable warmer option? :) http://www.polyvore.com/love_this_jeans/set?id=15496984 What do you think of the sorts of things so far?

6606	0	a	 A man walks up to the bar with an ostrich behind him  and as he sits  the bartender asks for their order.r r The man says  &quot;I'll have a beer&quot; and turns to the ostrich. &quot;What's yours?&quot; &quot;I'll have a beer too&quot; says the ostrich.r The bartender pours the beer and says &quot;That will be $3.40 please &quot; and the man reaches into his pocket and pays with the exact change for payment.r r The next day  the man and the ostrich come again  and the man says &quot;I'll have a beer &quot; and the ostrich says &quot;I'll have the same.&quot; Once again the man reaches into his pocket and pays with exact change.r r This became a routine until late one evening  the two enter again. &quot;The usual?&quot; asks the bartender.&quot;Well  it's close to last call  so I'll have a large Scotch&quot; says the man. &quot;Same for me&quot; says the ostrich. &quot;That will be $7.20&quot; says the bartender. Once again the man pulls exact change out of his pocket and places it on the bar.r r The bartender can't hold back his curiosity any longer. &quot;Excuse me  sir. How do you manage to always come up with the exact change out of your pocket every time?&quot;r r &quot;Well &quot; says the man  &quot;several years ago I was cleaning the attic and I found this old lamp. When I rubbed it a Genie appeared and offered me two wishes. My first wish was that if I ever needed to pay for anything  I just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money will be there.&quot;r r &quot;That's brilliant!&quot; says the bartender. &quot;Most people would wish for a million dollars or something  but you'll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live!&quot;&quot;That's right! Whether it's a gallon of milk  or a Rolls Royce  the exact money is always there &quot; says the man.r r &quot;That's fantastic!&quot; says the bartender. &quot;You are a genius! ... Oh  one other thing sir  what's with the ostrich?&quot;r r The man replies  &quot;Oh  my second wish was for a chick with long legs.&quot;

9030	0	a	 I actually have a really small family. In my close family  its me  my sister (who is 23) and our parents. Then I have one gran  2 uncles  one aunt and 2 cousins. Although I hardly see both of my uncles  they aren't really bothered about keeping in contact with the family  so eventually we have sort of lost touch :( I haven't seen one of my cousins for about 4/5 years. He got married  and ended up forgetting about his own family to move in on his wifes family and friends. So basically  that leaves my nan  cousin and aunt are the only people I really see. Its pretty sad :( My cousin  her dad (one of the uncles) also treated her really badly as a child (deliberately left her out of things  made her eat at a separate table over dinner  sent her to bed when she did nothing wrong  wouldn't let her go outside etc) so its another reason why the family don't worry about the uncle excusing himself from the family.  Both of my other grandparents have passed away :( Grampy when I was 3  Nan when I was 5 (and I still remember that :'() and 'Pop' (grandfather) when I was 15. So  a pretty small loose family unit I would say :(

She actually felt vunerable  and all I was routing for  is the &quot;Katie fucking Fitch&quot; back :P It will be interesting to see how she is in the next few episodes. Considering she doesn't think she is 'her' anymore  she is having an identity crisis  and I would like to see how that pans out :)

9545	0	a	 This is a difficult question. Even if there wasn't a year of my life in the balance  I don't know if I would. When you lose the people that you love  its so so painful  and to get them back  even for a moment  you know you are going to go through all that pain again. Is it worth it? So no  I probably wouldn't :(

9886	0	a	 Partner who is extremely difficult. Just because  living alone  its going to leave you depressed anyway  no one truly likes to live alone. So at least  someone who could be difficult  at least they would make you feel something. Even if one minute it was passion  the next anger  its better to feel something over nothing. I would choose the harder option  because no one deserves to be alone :)

9877	0	a	 I would yeah. Even though that would be TERRIFYING to know  but if there was no way I could prevent it from happening  then I would like to make sure I spend it with the people that I love. I couldn't bare dying when there are people who don't know how much I care about them. Its an important issue to me  which is why I always try to tell people  as much as possible how much I care. You never know when something could happen right? So its best to make sure you do the things that you really would need to before something happened :( Morbid! lol

1882	0	a	 thats really a hard question. and to be honest i dont think i could care for the amount of children that are being abused and self sacrifice my entire life for them. thats really harsh and makes me sound awful but that exact senario is happening next to my parents house and when i was about 18 i thought that is something i would have been willing to do but now i see them and how far they are that it would almost be mear unfair and unsuccessful on my part for them. its all they know. and if the state wont do anything its sad to say but what could i do by ripping them from the only home they do know and tell them its all wrong. i guess im not that selfless. and its like 12 kids. so that would be a lot. idk. but rightnow  i dont think so. just because im not in any way capable of taking care of them any better rightnow anyways. other than the not abusing them but whats worse?
875	0	a	 Yes ma'am :] thank you lady.

Ohh  in class once  in year 4 at primary school (I was about 8) I was chatting in class and the teacher asked me to be quiet  but I carried on talking and she told me off in front of the class  and said she was ringing my mum and asking her to come to the school  to talk about my behavior. I burst out crying  and had to leave the class room. Later on  the parental-teacher chat  consisted of my teacher telling my mum  that she was proud of me for doing something wrong because I was always such a good girl LOL!!!!

1410	0	a	 nahhh i just hang up
9681	0	a	 My style? You mean with hair  make-up  clothing etc? Shall I answer all? lol So hair style  i'm not one of those people who like their hair to look perfect all the time. On occasion  yeah I like to style it but im not anal about it being perfect. I absolutely LOVE messy hair  so I use the natural wave thats in my hair  to create a messy and  kind of bed-head look. I use more hairspray than I probably should  but I like the end effect :) My make-up style  I prefer a natural make-up look for daytime  for example a little eyeliner and gold tone eye shadows. For evening or clubs (depending on my clothing) I LOVE a black smokey eye look (only when its done properly) so I might do something with dark eyeshadows and black makeup  but keep a natural base and nude lips. My clothing...well...do you have a year? lol I don't really go by what things say in magazines or in the fashion world at all. I like to wear what I want  and I don't give a shit if anyone else doesn't like it. I suppose in Skins sense (to refer it to someone) I wear a lot of Effy kind of inspired clothes (slashes  white/black  chains etc) but I like to mix it with different prints and/or colours. Imagine a mix of Effy  Naomi and Emily  and you have my kind of style lol. I once wore my satin dressing gown out as a jacket LOL! It was to a Skins House Party actually  and its blue and a floral pattern  you may have seen it :) So all in all  fuck other people  look how you want to look :)

9684	0	a	 Well I would LOVE to direct Horror films ideally. Just because they aren't so much about the writing  but more about the direction of the film. You need to think about so many more things  eg cinematography (lighting)  angles  editing. Everything is so much more creative than your standard Rom Com. Its more interesting and much more of a challenge to do it successfully :)
